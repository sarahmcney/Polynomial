# Polynomial

**This was the first project assigned in Rutgers 01:198:112 (Data Structures).

In this project, I implemented a polynomial and performed operations on it using only a linked list. The program gives users the option to either add two polynomials, multiply two polynomials, or evaluate a polynomial given any x.
